# Basic classification

## Why this is important

Exploitation of the spatial data depends highly on its reusability in the sense of FAIR principles. In particular, it is important to understand the generic nature of data types and their specializations in the marine domains. It allows to speak the same language and select the right technologies based on the character of the data and common sense.

# Marine data types

Marine data used and produced by the Iliad project embrace various types like in-situ observations, satellite imagery, citizen science data, model outputs.
Nevertheless, their basic types are common to the wider geospatial ecosystem and include:
*Vector data
**Point - e.g. point of observation
**Line/Multiline - e.g. vessel trace
**Polygon/Multipolygon - e.g. spatial extent of administration area, protected area
*Coverages


More sophisticated types like Trangle,
