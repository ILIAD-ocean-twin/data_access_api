      "Description:  Abstract: This project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the University of Hawaii, BAE Systems Spectral Solutions and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The goal of the work was to map the coral reef habitats of American Samoa, Guam and the Common Wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands by visual interpretation and manual delineation of IKONOS satellite imagery. A two tiered habitat classification system was tested and implemented in this work.  It integrates geomorphologic reef structure and biological cover into a single scheme and subsets each into detail.  It also includes thirteen zones.  Benthic features were mapped that covered an area of 71.5 square kilometers of which 10.56 were unconsolidated sediment and 60.94 were coral reef and hard bottom.  Of the coral reef and hard bottom class, 62.8% is colonized by greater than 10% coral cover. Purpose: The National Ocean Service is conducting a map production effort to digitally map biotic resources and coordinate a long-term monitoring program that can detect and predict change in U.S. coral reefs, and their associated habitats and biological communities\n",

A zone refers to each benthic community's geographic location and geomorphological structure. The geographic zone map was manually digitized the shoreline and the zone features for the entire area of interest in ArcGIS at the 1:6000 scale. The map was classified into 12 geographic zones based on the schema that has been developed by the Biogeography Branch, and which also match the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). Purpose: A zone map is important to understand the biogeography of a region.  Zones show the broader picture of how habitats are created and interconnected geospatially. A zone is not classified by the biological cover or hard/soft bottom ratio, but instead is based on the structure of the reef system and their connections to the land. The interplay of the complex geology of the Caribbean, the changes in sea level, and the proliferation/degradation of coral reef systems of Puerto Rico affect the distribution of the plant and animal life and their habitats in the region\n",

      "Description: Abstract: Benthic habitat maps of Buck Island National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands were created using a combination of semi-automated classification and visual interpretation techniques of acoustic and passive optical imagery. The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), was to provide spatially-explicit information describing the benthic habitat types and live coral cover present within BIRNM.  The data contained in this shapefile represent the mean locations of the 346 accuracy assessment (AA) sites explored by NOAA field scientists. Purpose: The purpose of this survey was to collect information on current habitat conditions at random locations throughout the mapping area.  Locations were determined by an iterative, GIS-based, stratified random sampling technique to ensure that all bottom classifications would be assessed.  This information was used to evaluate the thematic accuracy of the BIRNM habitat maps up to depths of 40 m. Supplemental_Information: Data were collected on 346 accuracy assessment sites over a week-long field mission from 8/25/11 to 8/31/11 aboard the U.S. National Park Service small R/V Osprey.  Based on guidelines from other recent NOAA accuracy assessment analyses (Battista et al. 2007), a minimum of 25 points were assigned to each of the detailed structure classes within the draft habitat map.  Additional points were distributed based on the proportion of area of each structure class in the map.  Several pre-selected sites were inaccessible by field scientists or were not classified due to visibility restrictions\n",

      "Description: Abstract: This shapefile contains information about the geology and biology of the seafloor from approximately 30 to 150 meters in Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). It was created by concurrently delineating habitats visible in a 10x10 meter acoustic backscatter surface and a 10x10 meter principal component surface derived using ENVI's Feature Extraction (Fx) Module.  Habitat polygons less than 1,000 square meters were removed using ET Geowizards extension to ArcGIS. Additional habitat polygons were manually digitized at a scale of 1:1,000 if they were excluded during the feature extraction workflow.  Polygon boundaries were smoothed in ArcGIS to reduce their pixelated appearence.  Each habitat polygon was manually classified using georeferenced underwater video and photos collected using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Major and detailed geomorphological structure, percent hardbottom, major and detailed biological cover and liver coral cover were identified for each polygon. The final map was reviewed qualitatively by local experts for accuracy however, no quantitative accuracy assessment was conducted. This map is a baseline for future habitat studies, as it marks the first time that habitats deeper than approximately 30 meters have been mapped in the Monument. Purpose: This benthic habitat map was created by NOAA to support the management of Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) by the National Park Service (NPS).  The mosaic of coral reef, seagrass and sand habitats in BIRNM are home to a diversity of marine organisms, including Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), Elkhorn Coral (Acropora palmata) and Staghorn Coral (Acropora cervicornis), all of which are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act (NOAA OPR, 2011). In addition to providing habitat for a variety of species, these marine resources also provide valuable ecosystem services to the local community, including shoreline protection, fisheries replenishment, recreation, and tourism. However, coral reef ecosystems in St. Croix and throughout the U.S. Caribbean are under increasing pressure from environmental and anthropogenic stressors that threaten these important marine communities. In order to better evaluate and address these threats, a baseline understanding and periodic evaluation of the benthic communities and associated living marine resources is needed by scientists and resource managers. Habitat maps, in particular, are an integral component to this process, as they support an effective ecosystem-based approach to management. Habitat maps provide a spatially explicit representation of benthic structure and biological cover. The spatial products developed for this project will: (1) inform local NPS managers as to the existing distribution of resources, (2) provide a baseline for future comparative efforts, (3) help locate sensitive marine communities, and (4) guide monitoring efforts and prioritize management actions\n",

      "Description: Abstract: This project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the University of Hawaii, BAE Systems Spectral Solutions and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The goal of the work was to map the coral reef habitats of American Samoa, Guam and the Common Wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands by visual interpretation and manual delineation of IKONOS satellite imagery. A two tiered habitat classification system was tested and implemented in this work.  It integrates geomorphologic reef structure and biological cover into a single scheme and subsets each into detail.  It also includes thirteen zones.  Benthic features were mapped that covered an area of 71.5 square kilometers of which 10.56 were unconsolidated sediment and 60.94 were coral reef and hard bottom.  Of the coral reef and hard bottom class, 62.8% is colonized by greater than 10% coral cover. Purpose: The National Ocean Service is conducting a map production effort to digitally map biotic resources and coordinate a long-term monitoring program that can detect and predict change in U.S. coral reefs, and their associated habitats and biological communities\n",

      "Description: Abstract: This shapefile denotes the location of underwater photos and videos taken in shallow water (0-35m) benthic habitats surrounding Northeast Puerto Rico and Culebra Island. The area includes the nearshore waters of Fajardo and Luqillo to the Former Roosevelt Roads Navy Base, the Vieques Sound, La Cordillera Reserve, the Luis Pena Reserve, and the waters around Culebra Island. The Accuracy Assessment data contains GPS-positioned underwater photo/videos of selected benthic habitats that were used to assess the accuracy of the benthic habitat polygons created by the Biogeography Team. The observations from the videos are used to rate the amount of error in the polygons that delineate habitat features. The AA data was collected in September 3 &#150; 15, 2014. The field work was conducted by NOAA together with local DRNA and NOAA contractors. Purpose: The primary purpose of this dataset was to assess the thematic accuracy of a benthic habitat map for the Northeast Reserve, Puerto Rico (NEPR). Habitat maps provide a spatially explicit representation of benthic structure and biological cover. The accuracy assessment also provides analysts with georeferenced video data that contains biological and ecological information. The spatial products developed for this project will: (1) inform local managers as to the current distribution of resources, (2) provide a point of comparison for past and future mapping efforts, (3) help locate sensitive marine communities, and (4) guide monitoring efforts and prioritize management actions\n",

In the 2020 Cogea started to collect and harmonize them according to the EMOdnet Human Activities dataset schema. The EMODnet dataset is updated yearly and as soon as new data from ICES are released, and is available for viewing and download on the EMODnet web portal (Human Activities, https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities). Where and when available, the fisheries overview data concern: i) the spatial distribution of average annual fishing effort (mW fishing hours) by ecoregion (Azores, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Baltic Sea, Barents Sea, Celtic Seas, Faroes, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, Norwegian Sea and Oceanic Northeast Atlantic) and by gear type (Beam trawls, Bottom otter trawls, Bottom seines, Dredges, Pelagic trawls and seines, Static gears). Fishing effort data are only shown for vessels >12 m having vessel monitoring systems (VMS); ii) the average annual subsurface (top) and surface (bottom) mobile bottom contacting fishing gear (i.e. bottom otter trawls, bottom seines, dredges, beam trawls) disturbance by ecoregion in the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Baltic Sea, Barents Sea, Celtic Seas, Faroes, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, Norwegian Sea and Oceanic Northeast Atlantic, expressed as average swept-area ratios (SAR). Due to data confidentiality issues, VMS/logbook data are anonymized and aggregated in a 0.05×0.05 degree grid prior to submission to ICES, using the C-squares geocode system (polygons). The last data loaded into the database, from the ICES 2022 Fishing Overview, report the 2018-2021 averages.

      "Description: Abstract: Benthic habitat maps of Buck Island National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands were created using a combination of semi-automated classification and visual interpretation techniques of acoustic and passive optical imagery. The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), was to provide spatially-explicit information describing the benthic habitat types and live coral cover present within BIRNM.  The data contained in this shapefile represent the periodic positioning of georeferenced ROV transects. Purpose: NOAA's Biogeography Branch used the habitat information collected during 2005-2006 ROV missions to carry out the manual classifications of the deeper draft maps (which stretched from depths of 40-1600 m). Supplemental_Information: Underwater video and habitat data from 12 transects conducted within the BIRNM were used to create the 110 classified points used for mapping. This positioning dataset for these two survey years includes 2007 static locations of the two ROV's. These ROV dives were conducted between 2/1/05-2/12/05, and 3/21/06-4/2/06, and their paths were selected based on preliminary analysis of broadscale multibeam surveys in the same area\n",

      "Description: Abstract: This shapefile contains information about the geology and biology of the seafloor from approximately 150 to 1,830 meters in Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). It was created by delineating habitats visible in a 50x50 meter principal component surface derived from a suite of acoustic images using ENVI's Feature Extraction (Fx) Module.  Habitat polygons less than 5,000 square meters were removed using ET Geowizards extension to ArcGIS. Additional polygons were manually digitized at a scale of 1:1,000 if they were missed during the feature extraction workflow.  Polygon boundaries were smoothed in ArcGIS to reduce their pixelated appearence.  Each habitat polygon was manually classified using georeferenced underwater video and photos collected using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Major and detailed geomorphological structure, percent hardbottom, major and detailed biological cover and live coral cover were identified for each polygon.  The final map was reviewed qualitatively by local experts for accuracy however, no quantitative accuracy assessment was conducted. This map is a baseline for future habitat studies, as it marks the first time that habitats deeper than approximately 30 meters have been mapped inside BIRNM. Purpose: This benthic habitat map was created by NOAA to support the management of Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) by the National Park Service (NPS).  The mosaic of coral reef, seagrass and sand habitats in BIRNM are home to a diversity of marine organisms, including Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), Elkhorn Coral (Acropora palmata) and Staghorn Coral (Acropora cervicornis), all of which are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act (NOAA OPR, 2011). In addition to providing habitat for a variety of species, these marine resources also provide valuable ecosystem services to the local community, including shoreline protection, fisheries replenishment, recreation, and tourism. However, coral reef ecosystems in St. Croix and throughout the U.S. Caribbean are under increasing pressure from environmental and anthropogenic stressors that threaten these important marine communities. In order to better evaluate and address these threats, a baseline understanding and periodic evaluation of the benthic communities and associated living marine resources is needed by scientists and resource managers. Habitat maps, in particular, are an integral component to this process, as they support an effective ecosystem-based approach to management. Habitat maps provide a spatially explicit representation of benthic structure and biological cover. The spatial products developed for this project will: (1) inform local NPS managers as to the existing distribution of resources, (2) provide a baseline for future comparative efforts, (3) help locate sensitive marine communities, and (4) guide monitoring efforts and prioritize management actions\n",

(2013). Shipwrecks Database. Version 1.0. Accessed (date): oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/) for archeological remains of ship wrecks in the Mediterranean. The different products were developed with different purposes and therefore provide information of different nature. The product developed by SHOM aims to identify objects emerging from the seabed and likely to hinder navigation, while the three other products focus on the historical value of the wrecks. The choice was made to keep as much information as possible. When possible fields from different sources have been merged (e.g. least depth available in SHOM data and the Oxford Roman Economy Project), but other fields correspond to a specific source. When available, information is provided on the nature of the objects (object description, ship characteristics, object type, artefacts, estimated tonnage), on the aging of the wrecks (sink year, dating, period), on the circumstances of the sinking (sink context, place of origine, place of destination), on the location  (least depth, max depth, other depth information, object length, location precision, site area, coast distance), on the protection status (only for England) and on sources and additional information available (source information, references, website, website 2). The additional processing carried out by EMODnet consisted in translating the available information to English (through partly-automated translation), extracting the year of the sinking when available and calculating the distance to coast. Last update of the product by SHOM was made in November 2021, last update of the Historic England data was made in August 2021, update of the National Monument Service Wreck Viewer in Ireland was made I April 2018 and the Oxford Roman Economy Project was carried out in 2013.\n",

It is the result of the aggregation and harmonization of datasets provided by national sources across the EU (plus Norway and the UK) and by the project Euroshell. The dataset contains points representing shellfish farms or shellfish production areas (depending on available data) in the following countries: Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and United Kingdom. Data from Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Norway, Spain and Scotland come from the official lists of registered aquaculture sites. Data from France relies on cadastral data. Data from the Netherlands, Italy and England and Wales come from the Euroshell project. Data is missing for Germany, Portugal, Sweden and Croatia. Except for Germany, the shellfish production remains limited in those MS. There is no production in other MS. Each point has the following attributes (where available): status (active, inactive, licensed), country, owner name, farm type (Mussels, Oysters, Mussels-Oysters, Clams, Specialised (other), Mixed (other)), production method (Beds, Long lines,  Rafts,    Saltwater closed (recirculation),   Saltwater ponds, Saltwater tanks/raceways, Trestles or trays, Other), production stage (Grow out for human consumption, Hatchery, Nursery, Broodstock, Reproduction,  Harvest, Other), purpose (Commercial, Research, Education, Display, Other), products detailed (English translation of the information provided on species grown or authorised in the source), point information (Polygon centroid, Original) depending on how the information is provided in the source (polygons or points), site_id,  distance to coast (metres), position from coastline (At sea, within the coastline).  The farm type relies on a typology established by AND-International, based on available information on species grown or authorised. A relational table provides harmonised information about species grown or authorised using Eurostat nomenclature for the Species Group (Mussels; Oysters;  Clams, cockles, arkshells;  Scallops, pectens;  Abalones, winkles, conchs;  Sea-urchins and other echinoderms) and when available the species name (e.g. Blue mussels - Mytilus edulis). The distance to coast (EEA coastline shapefile) has been calculated using the original data map projections, where available. In the other cases it was used the UTM WGS84 Zone projected coordinate system where data fall in.

The goal of the work was to map the coral reef habitats of American Samoa, Guam and the Common Wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands by visual interpretation and manual delineation of IKONOS satellite imagery. A two tiered habitat classification system was tested and implemented in this work.  It integrates geomorphologic reef structure and biological cover into a single scheme and subsets each into detail.  It also includes thirteen zones.  Benthic features were mapped that covered an area of 71.5 square kilometers of which 10.56 were unconsolidated sediment and 60.94 were coral reef and hard bottom.  Of the coral reef and hard bottom class, 62.8% is colonized by greater than 10% coral cover. Purpose: The National Ocean Service is conducting a map production effort to digitally map biotic resources and coordinate a long-term monitoring program that can detect and predict change in U.S. coral reefs, and their associated habitats and biological communities\n",

The data contained in this shapefile represent the mean locations of the 39 ground validation (GV) sites explored by NOAA field scientists using a drop camera. Purpose: The purpose of this survey was to collect information on current habitat conditions at sites where cartographers decided the draft map could be improved with additional field data. This information was considered during the manual editing which followed the semi-automated map creation. Supplemental_Information: Data were collected on 39 ground validation sites over a week-long field mission from 8/25/11 to 8/31/11 aboard the U.S. National Park Service small R/V Osprey.

      "Description: Abstract: The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research efforts on subsets of EFH that are vulnerable to degradation or are especially important ecologically for federally managed fish. The HAPC designation alone does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.HAPCs are a subset of EFH that deserve special attention because they provide extremely important ecological functions and/or are especially vulnerable to degradation. For instance, HAPC designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of a managed species (e.g., grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from fishing or other human activities.Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or more of the following reasons:The habitat provides important ecological functionsThe habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradationDevelopment activities are, or will be, stressing the habitatThe habitat type is rare. Purpose: The purpose of this dataset was to combine the individual HAPC feature classes from each region into one standardized and uniform dataset with proper metadata. A new set of attributes was created to store a common set of attributes with the most simplified information and provide linkages back to the original source documents.\n",

The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), was to provide spatially-explicit information describing the benthic habitat types and live coral cover present within BIRNM.  The data contained in this shapefile represent the derived locations of 1288 NOAA diver quadrats visited between 2007-2010 and employed as regions of interest (ROI's) in the semi-automated habitat mapping workflow.  Purpose: NOAA's Biogeography Branch used the 2007-2010 diver habitat information to train the classification algorithms that are crucial for the semi-automated mapping work. This dataset represents the location of the transects from 2010 monitoring, during which underwater video was recorded along the transects. Supplemental_Information: 57 transects are included. These locations were visited over the course of the 10/18/10-10/29/10 dive mission.

      "Description: The dataset on marine finfish aquaculture in the European seas was created in 2017 by AND-International for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). The dataset provides information about the location of marine finfish farms in the EU and partner countries where data are available. There is an obligation for EU MS to inventory all authorized aquaculture sites under the Council Directive 2006/88/EC on animal health requirements. Despite this obligation, the availability of data varies among MS from no data available at all to a complete regularly updated dataset (e.g.in Ireland). As far as partner countries are concerned, data have been collected only in Norway and the UK (Scotland only) at this stage, where detailed data are provided online. Data provided here cover Cyprus, Danmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Spain and the UK (Scotland only). Data collection is still undergoing in other EU MS and neighbouring countries. Each point has the following attributes (where available): Country, Owner name, Status (Active, Expired, Inactive, Renewal, n.a.), Farm type (Flatfish, Diversified farm, Other specialised farm, Salmon, Salmonids, Seabass-seabream, Trout,Tuna, n.a.), Production method (Sea cages, Saltwater tanks/raceways, Saltwater ponds, Saltwater closed (recirculation), Quarantine, Other, n.a.), Production stage (Grow out for human consumption, Hatchery, Nursery, Brood stock, Reproduction, Restoration of wild stock, Put and take fisheries, Processing facility, Salughtering facility, Other, n.a.), Purpose (Commercial, Restocking, Other, n.a.), Products detailed (detailed product information names as presented in the source and translated to English), Point information (Polygon centroid, Original) depending on how the information is provided in the source (polygons or points), Site_ID.  The farm type relies on a typology established by AND-International, based on available information on species grown. A relational table provides harmonised information about species grown using Eurostat nomenclature for the Species Group (Cods, hakes, haddocks; Flounders, halibuts, soles; Miscellaneous coastal fishes, Miscellaneous demersal fishes; Miscellaneous pelagic fishes; Salmons, trouts, smelts;Tunas, bonitos, billfishes), the species name (commercial and scientific) and the code. Compared with the previous version this new version has been not only updated but was also reviewed (dataset schema and attributes values), in order to add information on production methods, production stages and purposes and to provide a more useful typology based on species grown.

The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), was to provide spatially-explicit information describing the benthic habitat types and live coral cover present within BIRNM.  The data contained in this shapefile represent the derived locations of 1288 NOAA diver quadrats visited between 2007-2010 and employed as regions of interest (ROIï¿½s) in the semi-automated habitat mapping workflow.  Purpose: NOAAï¿½s Biogeography Branch used the 2007-2010 diver habitat information to train the classification algorithms that are crucial for the semi-automated mapping work. Supplemental_Information: Data from 1288 transect quadrats were synthesized. These locations were visited over the course of six dive missions, from 10/8/07-10/17/07, 3/10/08-3/19/08, 10/20/08-10/29/08, 3/2/09-3/13/09, 10/27/09-11/6/09, and 10/18/10-10/29/10.

      "Description: Abstract: This shapefile contains information about the geology and biology of the seafloor from approximately 0 to 30 meters in Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). It was created by delineating habitats visible in a 0.35x0.35 meter orthophotograph, a 1x1 meter LiDAR relative reflectivity surface, 1x1 meter acoustic backscatter surface, and 1x1 meter principal component surface using ENVI's Feature Extraction (Fx) Module.  Habitat polygons less than 100 square meters were removed using ET Geowizards extension to ArcGIS. Additional habitat polygons were manually digitized at a scale of 1:1,000 if they were excluded during the feature extraction workflow.  Polygon boundaries were smoothed in ArcGIS to reduce their pixelated appearence.  A Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was used to classify each habitat polygon using georeferenced underwater video & photos collected using SCUBA divers, snorkeling and drop-cameras. Major and detailed geomorphological structure, percent hardbottom, major and detailed biological cover and live coral cover were identified for each polygon. The thematic accuracy of the map was assessed qualitatively by local experts and quantitatively using randomly sampled locations stratified by detailed geomorpholoigcal structure type.  Major and detailed geomorphological structure, detailed biological cover and live coral cover thematic accuracies were: 94.4%, 85.2%, 81.4%, and 90.1%, respectively. These thematic accuracies are similar to the thematic accuracies reported for other NOAA benthic habitat mapping efforts in St. John (>80%), the Main Eight Hawaiian Islands (>84.0%) and the Republic of Palau (>80.0%). Purpose: This benthic habitat map was created by NOAA to support the management of Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) by the National Park Service (NPS).  The mosaic of coral reef, seagrass and sand habitats in BIRNM are home to a diversity of marine organisms, including Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), Elkhorn Coral (Acropora palmata) and Staghorn Coral (Acropora cervicornis), all of which are federally protected under the Endangered Species Act (NOAA OPR, 2011). In addition to providing habitat for a variety of species, these marine resources also provide valuable ecosystem services to the local community, including shoreline protection, fisheries replenishment, recreation, and tourism. However, coral reef ecosystems in St. Croix and throughout the U.S. Caribbean are under increasing pressure from environmental and anthropogenic stressors that threaten these important marine communities. In order to better evaluate and address these threats, a baseline understanding and periodic evaluation of the benthic communities and associated living marine resources is needed by scientists and resource managers. Habitat maps, in particular, are an integral component to this process, as they support an effective ecosystem-based approach to management. Habitat maps provide a spatially explicit representation of benthic structure and biological cover. The spatial products developed for this project will: (1) inform local NPS managers as to the existing distribution of resources, (2) provide a baseline for future comparative efforts, (3) help locate sensitive marine communities, and (4) guide monitoring efforts and prioritize management actions\n",

The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), was to provide spatially-explicit information describing the benthic habitat types and live coral cover present within BIRNM.  The data contained in this shapefile represent the derived locations of 1288 NOAA diver quadrats visited between 2007-2010 and employed as regions of interest (ROI's) in the semi-automated habitat mapping workflow. Purpose: NOAA's Biogeography Branch used the 2007-2010 diver habitat information to train the classification algorithms that are crucial for the semi-automated mapping work. This dataset represents the location of the start points of transects that met two requirements: at least one of their quadrats was used as an ROI in the classification algorithm development, and at least one underwater photo was taken at the start point. Supplemental_Information: Data from 261 transects are included.

It was created by manually delineating and classifying habitats visible in a 0.3x0.3 meter aerial photograph mosaic, and by using edge detection algorithms and boosted regression trees to automatically delineate and classify habitat features visible in 0.3x0.3 meter LiDAR surfaces. Habitat features less than 100 square meters were not delineated from the orthomosaic, and were removed from habitat polygons derived from the LiDAR surfaces using ET Geowizards ArcGIS extension. Manually delineated habitat polygons were digitized at a scale of 1:1,000. Habitat polygon boundaries derived from the LiDAR surfaces were smoothed in ArcGIS to more closely match the 1:1,000 scale used for manual digitizing. Georeferenced underwater video &amp; photos were used to train the analyst and algorithm to classify the major and detailed geomorphological structure, percent hard bottom, major and detailed biological cover and live coral cover for each polygon. The thematic accuracy of the map was assessed qualitatively by local experts and quantitatively using randomly sampled locations stratified by detailed geomorpholoigcal structure type.

      "Description: Abstract: Benthic habitat maps of Buck Island National Monument (BIRNM), St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands were created using a combination of semi-automated classification and visual interpretation techniques of acoustic and passive optical imagery. The objective of this effort, conducted by NOAA's Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment - Biogeography Branch in partnership with the U.S. National Park Service (NPS), was to provide spatially-explicit information describing the benthic habitat types and live coral cover present within BIRNM.  The data contained in this shapefile represent points classified through the interpretation of georeferenced ROV transects. Purpose: NOAA's Biogeography Branch used the habitat information collected during 2005-2006 ROV missions to carry out the manual classifications of the deeper draft maps (which stretched from depths of 40-1600 m). Supplemental_Information: Underwater video and habitat data from 12 transects conducted within the BIRNM were used to create the 110 classified points included in this dataset. These ROV dives were conducted between 2/1/05-2/12/05, and 3/21/06-4/2/06, and their locations were selected based on preliminary analysis of broadscale multibeam surveys in the same area\n",

It is available for viewing and download on EMODnet - Human Activities web portal (https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities). Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs). The dataset covers the whole EU. Following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, it ceased to be part of the EEA’s institutional networks and governance. In the webmap the EEA dataset has been filtered by Cogea to show only (i) marine sites, i.e. sites with a marine area percentage higher than 0 (as calculated by the EEA) and (ii) sites that, even if not identified as marine by the EEA, intersect the EEA coastline or that are within a distance of 1 km from the coastline (using a 1 km inner buffer from the EEA coastline). In both cases the COAST_MAR field value=1. The EEA coastline dataset is available at https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2.

Where and when available, the fisheries overview data concern: i) the spatial distribution of average annual fishing effort (mW fishing hours) by ecoregion (Azores, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Baltic Sea, Barents Sea, Celtic Seas, Faroes, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, Norwegian Sea and Oceanic Northeast Atlantic) and by gear type (Beam trawls, Bottom otter trawls, Bottom seines, Dredges, Pelagic trawls and seines, Static gears). Fishing effort data are only shown for vessels >12 m having vessel monitoring systems (VMS); ii) the average annual subsurface (top) and surface (bottom) mobile bottom contacting fishing gear (i.e. bottom otter trawls, bottom seines, dredges, beam trawls) disturbance by ecoregion in the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Baltic Sea, Barents Sea, Celtic Seas, Faroes, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, Norwegian Sea and Oceanic Northeast Atlantic, expressed as average swept-area ratios (SAR). Due to data confidentiality issues, VMS/logbook data are anonymized and aggregated in a 0.05×0.05 degree grid prior to submission to ICES, using the C-squares geocode system (polygons). The last data loaded into the database, from the ICES 2022 Fishing Overview, report the 2018-2021 averages.

      "Description: The dataset combines data collected from several sources: data collected and processed by the “Service hydrographique et océanographique de la marine” (SHOM) under the product “Wrecks and obstructions” for France (Hexagone and outermost regions and territories), The National Monument Service Wreck Viewer for Ireland, Historic England and the University of Oxford - The Oxford Roman Economy Project (Strauss, J. (2013). Shipwrecks Database. Version 1.0. Accessed (date): oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/databases/shipwrecks_database/) for archeological remains of ship wrecks in the Mediterranean. The different products were developed with different purposes and therefore provide information of different nature. The product developed by SHOM aims to identify objects emerging from the seabed and likely to hinder navigation, while the three other products focus on the historical value of the wrecks. The choice was made to keep as much information as possible. When possible fields from different sources have been merged (e.g. least depth available in SHOM data and the Oxford Roman Economy Project), but other fields correspond to a specific source. When available, information is provided on the nature of the objects (object description, ship characteristics, object type, artefacts, estimated tonnage), on the aging of the wrecks (sink year, dating, period), on the circumstances of the sinking (sink context, place of origine, place of destination), on the location  (least depth, max depth, other depth information, object length, location precision, site area, coast distance), on the protection status (only for England) and on sources and additional information available (source information, references, website, website 2). The additional processing carried out by EMODnet consisted in translating the available information to English (through partly-automated translation), extracting the year of the sinking when available and calculating the distance to coast. Last update of the product by SHOM was made in November 2021, last update of the Historic England data was made in August 2021, update of the National Monument Service Wreck Viewer in Ireland was made I April 2018 and the Oxford Roman Economy Project was carried out in 2013.\n",

      "Description: Abstract: The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research efforts on subsets of EFH that are vulnerable to degradation or are especially important ecologically for federally managed fish. The HAPC designation alone does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.HAPCs are a subset of EFH that deserve special attention because they provide extremely important ecological functions and/or are especially vulnerable to degradation. For instance, HAPC designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of a managed species (e.g., grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from fishing or other human activities.Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or more of the following reasons:The habitat provides important ecological functionsThe habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradationDevelopment activities are, or will be, stressing the habitatThe habitat type is rare. Purpose: The purpose of this dataset was to combine the individual HAPC feature classes from each region into one standardized and uniform dataset with proper metadata. A new set of attributes was created to store a common set of attributes with the most simplified information and provide linkages back to the original source documents.\n",

      "Description: The dataset on marine finfish aquaculture in the European seas was created in 2017 by AND-International for the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). The dataset provides information about the location of marine finfish farms in the EU and partner countries where data are available. There is an obligation for EU MS to inventory all authorized aquaculture sites under the Council Directive 2006/88/EC on animal health requirements. Despite this obligation, the availability of data varies among MS from no data available at all to a complete regularly updated dataset (e.g.in Ireland). As far as partner countries are concerned, data have been collected only in Norway and the UK (Scotland only) at this stage, where detailed data are provided online. Data provided here cover Cyprus, Danmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Spain and the UK (Scotland only). Data collection is still undergoing in other EU MS and neighbouring countries. Each point has the following attributes (where available): Country, Owner name, Status (Active, Expired, Inactive, Renewal, n.a.), Farm type (Flatfish, Diversified farm, Other specialised farm, Salmon, Salmonids, Seabass-seabream, Trout,Tuna, n.a.), Production method (Sea cages, Saltwater tanks/raceways, Saltwater ponds, Saltwater closed (recirculation), Quarantine, Other, n.a.), Production stage (Grow out for human consumption, Hatchery, Nursery, Brood stock, Reproduction, Restoration of wild stock, Put and take fisheries, Processing facility, Salughtering facility, Other, n.a.), Purpose (Commercial, Restocking, Other, n.a.), Products detailed (detailed product information names as presented in the source and translated to English), Point information (Polygon centroid, Original) depending on how the information is provided in the source (polygons or points), Site_ID.  The farm type relies on a typology established by AND-International, based on available information on species grown. A relational table provides harmonised information about species grown using Eurostat nomenclature for the Species Group (Cods, hakes, haddocks; Flounders, halibuts, soles; Miscellaneous coastal fishes, Miscellaneous demersal fishes; Miscellaneous pelagic fishes; Salmons, trouts, smelts;Tunas, bonitos, billfishes), the species name (commercial and scientific) and the code. Compared with the previous version this new version has been not only updated but was also reviewed (dataset schema and attributes values), in order to add information on production methods, production stages and purposes and to provide a more useful typology based on species grown.

      "Description: The dataset on Natura 2000 sites was created in 2014 by Cogea for the European Marine Observation and Data Network. It is entirely based on spatial data from the European Environmental Agency (EEA), plus additional info, links and selected EEA data joined to the feature attributes, as well as a calculation by Cogea of marine and coastal location of features. It is available for viewing and download on EMODnet - Human Activities web portal (https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities). Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs). The dataset covers the whole EU. Following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, it ceased to be part of the EEA’s institutional networks and governance. In the webmap the EEA dataset has been filtered by Cogea to show only (i) marine sites, i.e. sites with a marine area percentage higher than 0 (as calculated by the EEA) and (ii) sites that, even if not identified as marine by the EEA, intersect the EEA coastline or that are within a distance of 1 km from the coastline (using a 1 km inner buffer from the EEA coastline). In both cases the COAST_MAR field value=1. The EEA coastline dataset is available at https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2. Compared with the previous version, this one includes the updated dataset 'Natura 2000 End 2021', published by the EEA in April 2021. For further information (e.g. biogeographic region, directive, habitats, sites, impact, management, species and metadata) please visit the EEA's website hosting the Natura 2000 tabular data.\n",

      "Description: The datasets on fishing intensity in the EU waters by sea basin are created every year by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). In the 2020 Cogea started to collect and harmonize them according to the EMOdnet Human Activities dataset schema. The EMODnet dataset is updated yearly and as soon as new data from ICES are released, and is available for viewing and download on the EMODnet web portal (Human Activities, https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/human-activities). Where and when available, the fisheries overview data concern: i) the spatial distribution of average annual fishing effort (mW fishing hours) by ecoregion (Azores, Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Baltic Sea, Barents Sea, Celtic Seas, Faroes, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, Norwegian Sea and Oceanic Northeast Atlantic) and by gear type (Beam trawls, Bottom otter trawls, Bottom seines, Dredges, Pelagic trawls and seines, Static gears). Fishing effort data are only shown for vessels >12 m having vessel monitoring systems (VMS); ii) the average annual subsurface (top) and surface (bottom) mobile bottom contacting fishing gear (i.e. bottom otter trawls, bottom seines, dredges, beam trawls) disturbance by ecoregion in the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast, Baltic Sea, Barents Sea, Celtic Seas, Faroes, Greater North Sea, Icelandic Waters, Norwegian Sea and Oceanic Northeast Atlantic, expressed as average swept-area ratios (SAR). Due to data confidentiality issues, VMS/logbook data are anonymized and aggregated in a 0.05×0.05 degree grid prior to submission to ICES, using the C-squares geocode system (polygons). The last data loaded into the database, from the ICES 2022 Fishing Overview, report the 2018-2021 averages. Compared with the previous one this new version has a new dataset schema and also historical data have been included in the database.\n",
