# Iliad metadata definitions

Iliad metadata definition defines minimum property set for the:
* catalog entry
* Features including measurement locations
* Coverage
* Sensors

The intent is to provide schemas and examples of the encodings for selected APIs, respectively:
* OGC Records
* OGC EDR collections, Locations, Features
* Potentially STA

For selected APIs, repository contains example configurations of the API service based on extensions of the reference implementations.

## Considered metadata definitions
### SeaDataNet

SeaDataNet schema for environmental (EDMED) data and Common Data Index (CDS):
https://www.seadatanet.org/Standards/Metadata-formats

CDS is considered for recommended compliance of catalog service - OGC API records.



Others to be considered in second order Cruise Summary Reports, EDMERP, EDIOS

### ISO 19115
SeaDataNet is the profile of the ISO19115. Same time OGC Records contains mappings to ISO:[link]
some other mappings:[links]

### GeoDCAT

## Approach
Iliad metadata definition is set of simple and composed properties and preferably their mappings to the reference specifications
